When a user visits the Services, an IP address, as well as the time of the visit and the page(s) accessed, may be automatically recognized and stored in our server log files. Collecting IP addresses is common practice, and many websites, apps, and other services do it automatically.

                <p>Information about the physical location</p>

                <p>Our Services and HTML-formatted emails include features that may necessitate the collection of various forms of location information (such as IP address, GPS coordinates, or postal code), which we subsequently use for the feature you have selected, such as:</p>

                    <li>Store Locator &amp; Where to Buy:</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Some of our Services allow you to look for the nearest store that sells the Ronix product you desire and also see whether those local stores have any of our products in stock. If you use a mobile device to access one of our Sites and allow location-based services, location information may be gathered for these features via satellite, cell phone tower, or WiFi signals, for example. If you&#39;re using a desktop device to access these features, you have the option of having your browser provide us with your location information based on your IP address, or you may be requested to provide us with your location information. Depending on the browser you&#39;re using and how you&#39;re connected to the internet, the specificity of the desktop device location information might vary. You may be able to stop location-based services on your mobile device settings, which will prevent our Sites from obtaining your specific mobile device location information.

                    <li>Email</li>
                </ul>

                <p>When you open an email from us, your IP address is used to identify the postal code where you are situated. This enables us to personalize content for you, such as a map of local stores that sell our products. The location&#39;s specificity varies based on the device used to open our emails. You may be able to disable the download of pixel tags or pictures in emails you receive from us using your email program, which will prevent our service provider from obtaining your location information. You can also opt out of getting our emails by following the instructions below.</p>

                <p>Please specify what Personal Information you want to be changed, whether you want your Personal Information removed from our database, or what restrictions you want to be placed on our use of your Personal Information in your request.

                <h5><strong>8. Third-Party Services </strong></h5>

                <p>Unrelated third parties that run websites independently from Ronix are granted licenses to use Ronix&#39;s trademarks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, such as any third party running any website or service to which the Services connect, or any third-party website or service on which Ronix maintains its Social Media Pages. These third parties have their own privacy policies, which we advise you to read carefully. The presence of a link on the Services does not mean that we or our affiliates endorse the linked site or service.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, we are not responsible for the policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, with respect to any Personal Information you disclose to them.</p>

                <h5><strong>9. Cross-border Data Transfer </strong></h5>

                <p>Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or use service providers, and by using the Services, you agree that your information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence. Courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in those other countries may have access to your Personal Information in certain circumstances.</p>

                <p>If you live in the European Economic Area, the European Commission has recognized several non-EEA countries as having a sufficient degree of data protection in accordance with EEA standards. We have put in place appropriate precautions, such as standard contractual terms established by the European Commission, to secure your Personal Information when it is transferred from the EEA to countries not regarded acceptable by the European Commission.</p>

                <h5><strong>10. Data Retention Period </strong></h5>

                <p>In light of the purpose(s) for which your information was collected and in accordance with applicable law, we keep Personal Information for as long as necessary or authorized.</p>

                <p>The following factors are taken into account to determine our retention periods:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The duration of our continuous connection with you and provision of the Services to you (for example, as long as you have an account with us or continue to use the Services);</li>
                    <li>Whether we are bound by legal duty or not (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a particular length of time before deleting them)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Please be aware that if you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will retain a record of your e-mail address in order to ensure that we do not send you marketing emails in the future.</p>

                <h5><strong>11. Minors using services</strong></h5>

                <p>Individuals under the age of eighteen (18) are not permitted to use the Services, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from them.</p>

                <h5><strong>12. Information that must be kept private</strong></h5>

                <p>We ask that you do not send us and that you do not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information about racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background, or trade union membership) via the services or otherwise. We will collect and process such information in accordance with applicable law if you choose to provide it to us or if we are asked to do so by you in the course of investigating a complaint or dispute regarding the Services.</p>

                <h5><strong>13. Payment services provided by third parties</strong></h5>

                <p>Payments made through the Services may be processed by a third-party payment provider. If you use the Services to make a payment, the third party will collect your Personal Information, not us, and it will be subject to the third party&#39;s privacy policies rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over and are not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of your Personal Information by this third party.</p>

                <h5><strong>14. Will this Privacy Policy be changed in the future?</strong></h5>

                <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time, so please check it frequently. When we modify the Privacy Policy, we will update the date. If you continue to use the Services after these changes, you are agreeing to the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
